WARNING:Power:1337 - Clock frequency for clock net "clk_BUFGP" is zero.
WARNING:Power:1337 - Clock frequency for clock net "clk_BUFGP/IBUFG" is zero.

WARNING:Power:1337 - Clock frequency for clock net "datapath_0/Adder16_0/a[15]_b[14]_OR_2_o" is zero.
WARNING:Power:1369 - Clock frequency for one or more clocks was not found through
   timing constraints (PCF file) or simulation data.  Without knowing the
   clock frequency of all clocks, dynamic power information for those clock
   domains will default to zero which may under-estimate the power for this
   design.  To avoid this warning, provide at least one of the following:
     1. The proper timing constraints (PERIOD) for clocks (re-implement design
        and load the newly generated PCF file into XPower Analyzer)
     2. A post PAR simulation-generated VCD or SAIF file indicating clock
        frequencies
     3. The clock frequency for clocks in the "By Type -> Clocks" view in the
        XPower Analyzer GUI and then applying "Update Power Analysis"
Power report saved as Neuron.pwr.
